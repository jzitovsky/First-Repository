```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg)
```

3.2.1) I see a gray screen
```{r}
nrow(mpg)
ncol(mpg)
```

3.2.2) There are 234 rows and 11 columns in mpg
```{r}
?mpg
```

3.2.3) drv is a categorical indicating whether the car is front-wheel drive, rear-wheel drive or 4-wheel drive
```{r}
ggplot(data=mpg)+geom_point(mapping=aes(x=cyl,y=hwy))
```

3.2.4) Above gives a scatterplot of hwy vs. cyl
```{r}
ggplot(data=mpg)+geom_point(mapping=aes(y=class,x=drv))
```

3.2.5) this plot isn't useful because it is a scatterplot of two multinomial variables, and thus relationsihps cannot be easily seen. Scaterplots are best when dealing with countinuous or ordinal variables.
